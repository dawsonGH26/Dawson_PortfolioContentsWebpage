        <p>My name is Dawson Ring. I grew up and was raised in McIntire Iowa until I was 6. After that me, my mom and my sister moved to Florida until I was 17, at which we moved back to McIntire for good. My experiences in Florida helped me understand diversity and appreciate it while still staying firmly grounded in my morals and beliefs. While I was in Florida, I had no true goal for my career path. It wasn't until we moved back to my roots would I discover my true passion: Programming</p>
        <p>When I returned to Iowa and went to high school there, my career path was undefined to say the least. Then, one day, I was assigned to a computer science class. This is where everything changed. Without getting into detail, I could basically manipulate lines on the screen and make them act in such a way that it resembles a videogame. This was the initial experience that made me decide to dive into the world of programming. For me, programming was a curiosity turned into a passion</p>
        <p>That being said, I have a very analytical mindset that is always asking questions. Even if my program works, I am not satisfied if I dont know the why because then I can't alter it to use it in a different way in the future. This is what makes me love programming: it never gets old; it never gets boring. On top of that you can use it in virtually any field, from the medical field to the entertainment industry; programming's potential benefits are endless.</p>
